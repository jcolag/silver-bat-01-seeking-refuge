Source files for an open novel

The final version of the e-books can be found [on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/seekingrefuge/page/n15).

I would give some background on the novel, here, but have already done that in the book itself in [the Credits](text/20-credits.md).  There, you will find the inspirations and sources for *pretty much* everything in the story.

If you see anything that doesn't work---structurally or narratively---feel free to [submit](https://github.com/jcolag/silver-bat-01-seeking-refuge/pulls) a [pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) or [file an issue](https://github.com/jcolag/silver-bat-01-seeking-refuge/issues), keeping in mind that I'll (obviously) maintain final editorial control of the story.

# Just Another Night in the Life

Clang, clang, clang.  Bang, rat-a-tat.  Clang, clang, clang, clang.  Rat-a-tat.  This is getting repetitive.

Weeks of planning, and some nights, it still just comes down to running across the city's catwalks dodging gunfire.  Typical.  What's the saying?  No plan survives---

"'No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength,' madame, as stated by Helmuth von Moltke the Elder," he corrects me over the radio.  I didn't think I said any of that out loud.  Also typical, unfortunately.

The plan started out well enough.  Truth be told, it's not going all that badly now, either, except for the bullets.  Speaking of which...

"Jeeves, the apartments ahead are definitely abandoned," I ask.  I'm really not in the mood to stomp on these creeps with an audience available to be taken hostage.

"Indeed, it would appear that nobody has signed a lease for any of those squalid rooms in the three minutes since you last inquired, madame."

Jackass.

"You may also wish to know that Miss Jumaima is disabling the security cameras in your projected path as you reach them.  If any are not accessible to her, however, she sends her regrets in advance and suggests covering the lens."

Getting caught on camera is the last thing we need.

Oops!  A bullet nearly hit.  I probably shouldn't divide my focus with snide remarks about people helping out.  I don't need to fall hundreds of feet to my death, either.

Where was I?  Right, the easy job.  My local informants started hearing rumors about a sweatshop in Little Graustark a couple of weeks ago, tied up with Ouida Hepler's fast fashion line.  A cabbie we protected a few months back came forward to confirm the conditions.  Best our accountants can trace through the ledgers, the operation is probably technically run by the Central Anarchist Council, hiring immigrants from Javasu and keeping their passports in a safe to prevent their complaining about conditions, a disgusting but all too common practice around the world.

Distracting the guards was straightforward enough, a slightly sharp odor setting them on edge before coaxing a backfire out of a passing car.  Everyone was quite accommodating about that part.  With the guards out of the way, it's not hard to crack a safe when you're working over a fly-by-night operation like this, either, so we have their passports.  Asmait was even right on time with the bus, so I only needed to clear the guards as they began to turn back.

So, short version, all the workers are on a bus to a Wooster facility, where my people will get them good jobs and, for those that fear retribution from the Council, new identities.  All in all, not a bad night's work.

Except that I didn't account for the sweatshop or the Council hiring Xavier Exley.  The man has five best-actor awards and a decade of box office smashes under his belt, but one little encounter with a strange meteorite (or so he claims) that turns his hand into a necrotic mess that drains the life of anything he touches, and suddenly he thinks that moonlighting as a criminal henchman is a legitimate career move.  "The Black Fist," as if anybody could take that seriously.  There's even all kinds of "X marks the spot" motifs he could be using, but he has a blackened hand and punches people, so of course he's the Black Fist.

I could suggest that he's too old to spend his time like this, running around the city with his shirt unbuttoned trying to murder people, but then I might have to think about how close we are in age and the fact that I'm running on the same catwalks as him.

Either way, let me tell you, his touch _is_ cold enough to burn and takes the wind out of you, so that much about him is serious, at least.  "Would not recommend to a friend," as my kid would say.

However, I also can't have that kind of danger following the bus, hence the merry chase through the rarefied air of the city's upper catwalks.  Every time I'm up here, I'm reminded of how claustrophobic it feels.  It's strange, too.  Every move feels like it's leading into a trap, like the next step in any direction is going to smack right into a wall.  And yet, the upper catwalks are one of the few places in the city to get a clear view of the night sky, and that's not even to mention the hundreds of feet drop back down to ground level.  Leave it to the Seven Cities, of which there are really only two, to make a person feel isolated and trapped, suspended in as close to open air as the cities get.  It's a place of contradictions.

"Madame, you should know that, according to all current scans, we have still seen no new occupants in the housing ahead.  Repeat, no new occupants have been detected in the preceding two minutes."

I'm not sure if it bothers me more that he needed to twist the knife or that he knew I was genuinely about to ask.

Regardless, we're at the apartments, jutting out past the buildings they sit atop, to shadow the street even more than the other buildings.  Most importantly, it's empty, meaning those bullets I manage to dodge aren't threatening anybody but me.  And that means...

"Now!"

A flare passes right behind me, from down on the street.  The guards hesitate, which is all I need to switch catwalks and get behind them on the high ground.  In the distance, I vaguely hear the staccato of our shop-owner confederate barking to seem like the flare is part of a late-night sales promotion.

The distraction works.  A strike to the back of their knees and the rear two go down.

The man in the middle loses his balance.  He tips over the railing.  I'll get back to him after the others.

The leaders pivot.  A swift punch and Lefty's gun clatters to the catwalk below.  Righty lets off another rat-a-tat that goes high.  It leaves him open.

I dive, pushing the gun in Lefty's way, using his momentum to keep Righty in position.  Grabbing Righty's leg, I flip him into the apartment.  I hear the gun hit the back wall.

Lefty pulls a knife.  Middle is almost back up.  Pulling Middle over my shoulder, Lefty takes out his own partner and goes down.

It takes a little bit more work to get these creeps secure in the apartment.  Jeeves has a tip into the cops soon after.  They obviously won't give up the Council, might not even know the Council exists, but the guns will get them arrested and Ouida Hepler's people will provide evidence incriminating them to keep the Hepler name out of it.  They're sleazy, but predictable enough to plan around.

That just leaves...

"Face me!"

...Exley.  Did he hang back a few minutes just to make a dramatic entrance?  Hardly worth the trouble in high-end jeans and a flannel shirt.  Every time I need to deal with him, I'm surprised by how much shorter he is in person.

"So," he intones as if he's trying to impress some invisible director, "it is down to you and it is down to me, foul fiend who was once my ally."  Wait, he's shouting dialogue from the _Revenge of the Serpent Emperor_ series.  I knew he wasn't creative, but this is a completely different level.

He jabs, coming too close.

"Madame, you will recall that he drains energy proportional to the momentum of his hand," comes over the earpiece.  Yes, yes, dodge the fist, as if that wasn't already a priority.

Jab, jab.  He's more aggressive with the normal hand, possibly so I'll focus on those punches for a while.

One, two.  One, two.  He learned to box, somewhere along the way.

Sirens.  The cops are almost here.

One, two.  One, two.  One, two, a slight step for a haymaker.  His fist flies out.  I use the opportunity to slip inside his reach and slap handcuffs on his wrist.  Then, over he goes, where I cuff the other end to the railing.  The cops will want to chat with Mister ExEx, here, about some extortion cases, so he won't be dangling here for too long, assuming they're not on the take.

I can hear Cibola's finest breaking down the apartment door.  Unfortunately, they would also want to have a chat with the mystery woman leaving a trail of beaten-up lackeys.  The empty apartments weren't the only reason I took the fight up here, however.

A quick vault to the window's lintel and sprint over the rooftop, and bingo!  A rat's nest of power and network cables most of the way down.  It's not the safest way to travel if there are any breakages in the insulation, but it's probably a lot safer than exposing the operation by openly jogging away from a crime scene.

No breakages in the cable.  Good.  I didn't feel like an electrocution, this time of night.  It takes over a minute to slide down to ground level, and I need to drop the last dozen feet or so down.  Ditch the sunglasses and beret, roll the turtleneck off my face, and grab a cheap blazer at one of the ground-level kiosks hawking wares at night, and just like that, the Silver Bat vanishes into the night.

A bullet grazed my leg, though.  I should probably take care of that.  And almost on cue, here's one of the kid's mobile clinics he thinks we don't know about.  The boy will go far, but needs to cover his tracks better.  We can help him do that.  Should.  We *should* help him do that, soon.

In fact, "Jeeves, put an appointment on my boy's calendar, tomorrow afternoon.  Say nothing about his birthday.  And tell the in-laws that it's time we let him work his magic, no excuses."  We used to need throat microphones to inconspicuously talk, but mobile phones changed that expectation, as long as we don't say anything incriminating.

"Indeed, madame, no excuses, no reference to Master Egbert's birthday."

"Excellent.  And see if Albert wants to go dancing after my leg stops throbbing.  We should celebrate.  Oh, and the party?"

"Scheduled with full attendance.  Miss Yelena has agreed to contrive an encounter that guides him to the museum's rear hall."

A passing kid takes two bucks to get me a bandage and some antiseptic from the clinic.  I probably should've offered him ten, but figured he'd haggle.  Oh, well.  I'll figure out who he is later and pay the family's rent.  Or buy the entire block and lower the rent.  People down here work to hard for not enough.

Tomorrow.  After the family business changes hands.  And dancing.  It has been a good night, with a new dawn just on the horizon.
